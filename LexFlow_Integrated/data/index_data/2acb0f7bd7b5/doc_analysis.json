Form 26AS is an annual statement\nmaintained under Rule 31AB of the Income-tax Rules disclosing the details of tax credit\nin the account of the taxpayer as per the database of Income-tax Department. In other\nwords, Form 26AS will reflect the details of tax credit appearing in the Permanent\nAccount Number of the taxpayer as per the database of the Income-tax Department.

Further, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)\n[As amended by Finance Act, 2025]\nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 329(E), dated 28-5-2020, has omitted Rule 31AB\nand inserted a new Rule 114-I to the Income-tax Rules, 1962.\nRule 114-I provides that an annual information statement in Form No. 26AS shall\nbe uploaded, by the Principal Director General of Income-tax (Systems) or the\nDirector General of Income-tax (Systems) or any person authorised by him, in the\ne-filing account of the assessee. Such statement shall be uploaded within 3\nmonths from the end of the month in which the information is received by him.\nThe scope of newly introduced Form 26AS has been expanded to cover certain\nadditional information such as information received under Double Taxation\nAvoidance Agreement or Tax Information Exchange Agreement.\nNew Form 26AS is divided into 2 parts. Part A contains certain basic information\nof the assessee, i.e., Permanent Account Number, Aadhaar number, Name, date of\nbirth/Incorporation, Mobile number, Email address and address. Part B contains\nthe information in respect of the following transaction:\na) Information relating to tax deducted or collected at source;\nb) Information relating to Specified Financial Transactions (SFT);\nc) Information relating to payment of taxes;\nd) Information relating to demand and refund;\ne) Information relating to pending proceedings;\nf) Information relating to completed proceedings; and\ng) Information received from any officer, authority or body performing any\nfunctions under any law or information received under an agreement referred\nunder section 90 or section 90A or information received from any other person to\nthe extent it may be deemed fit in the interest of the revenue.\nInformation in respect of Specified Financial Transactions will be reflected in Form 26AS\nonly if:\n1) Such transaction has been entered into for an amount in excess of the threshold\nprescribed section 285BA read with Rule 114E. Example, Cash deposited or\nwithdrawn from one or more current account for an amount of Rs. 50 lakh or\nmore; and\n2) Person with whom such transaction has been entered, has furnished a statement\nof financial transaction.\nProcedure to be followed in case of discrepancies in actual TDS and TDS credit\nas per Form 26AS\nEvery person deducting tax at source has to furnish the details of tax deducted by him\nto the Income-tax Department. The details will cover the name of the deductee,\nPermanent Account Number of the deductee, amount of tax deducted, amount paid to\nthe deductee, date of payment of TDS to the credit of Government, etc. On the basis\nof the details of TDS provided by the deductor, the Income-tax Department will\nupdate Form 26AS of the deductee.\nMany times the actual amount of TDS and TDS credit as appearing in Form 26AS\nmay differ and it may happen that the TDS credit appearing in Form 26AS may be\nless as compared to actual TDS, this may happen due to reasons like non-furnishing of\nTDS details to the Income-tax Department by the deductor, deducting the tax in\nincorrect Permanent Account Number, etc. In such a case the deductee should\n[As amended by Finance Act, 2025]\napproach the deductor and request him to take the necessary steps to rectify the\ndiscrepancy due to above reasons.\nThe Income-tax Department updates the TDS details in Form 26AS on basis of details\nprovided by the person deducting the tax (i.e., the deductor), hence, if there is any\ndefault on the part of deductor like non -furnishing of TDS details (i.e., TDS return) to\nthe Income-tax Department, deducting the tax in incorrect Permanent Account\nNumber, etc. then Form 26AS will not reflect the actual TDS. In such a case, the\ntaxpayer may not be able to claim the credit of correct TDS. Hence, the taxpayers are\nadvised to confirm the tax credit appearing in Form 26AS and should reconcile the\ndifference, if any.\nPrecautions to be taken while filing the return of income\nFollowing is the list of few important steps/points/precautions to be kept in mind\nwhile filing the return of income:\nThe first and foremost precaution is to file the return of income on or before\nthe due date.
